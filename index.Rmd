#### Motivation

  Lack of physical activity is a leading cause of disease and disability. For the UK, it has been estimated that "one in six deaths" is attributtable to physical inactivity. Increasing the level of physical activity of the population is therefore considered a key priority for public health.

  However, interventions to promote physical activity can have unintended consequences: health promotion activities are often taken up by those who are healthier anyway, and socio-economically deprived groups and other disadvantaged populations are frequently underrepresented. Evidence further suggests that populations from low socio-economic backgrounds may achieve poorer behaviour change and health outcomes following interventions. If not carfully designed, interventions to increase the levels of physcial activity could worsen the already stark health inequalities in the UK.
  
  Previous studies suggest that, [parkrun](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/), a grass-root running movement might offer some valuable lessons in this regard. parkrun seems to be particularly successful in encouraging participation in groups that are often underrepresented in health promotion activities ([Stevenson et al., 2014](https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article/36/2/268/1548895)). In fact, parkrun participants report that accessibility and inclusivity are among the main factors that contributed to their initial attendance and sustained involvement ([Stevinson et al., 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-9566.12622))

  Parkrun hosts five-kilometre running events in public parks on Saturday mornings. The events are organized by volunteers and participation is free. As of October 2018, there were 570 parkrun locations in the UK, and 1.8 million registered runners. For more info, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkrun) </div>

#### Research question
  
  This study aims to investigate the (potential) geographic access to parkrun events and the actual utilization. Based on our findings, we provide policy recommendation for increasing both. More specifically, we assessed:
  
    
  1. Who has access to parkrun events in England? We look at the relationship between the deprivation of an area and its geographic distance to the nearest parkrun event, to assess whether people in more deprived areas need to travel longer distances to participate. 
  
  2. Who participates in parkrun events? <mark>*-- Depending on data availability --*</mark> we will analyse participant data from parkrun events from 2018 to see from which areas the participants of parkrun events actually came: Are people from more deprived areas underrepreented? Do people from more affluent areas travel longer distances to attend running events? 
  
  3. We consider what we have learned from questions one and two and recommend locations for for starting new parkrun events, in order to either maximize geographic public access, or maximize utilization.
